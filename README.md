# Smarter Smart Contracts

Objective of this assignment was to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses, which form a part of a joint savings account. 
Smart contract is suppposed to use custom functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. 
These features are meant to consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account. To do this, user would create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity, Compile and Deploy the Contract in the Injected Web3 VM ( with Metamask and Ganache setup), and be able to interact with the Deployed Smart Contract.

## Technologies

This project uses below technologies interacting with Code in the Solidity Language:

- Remix IDE
- Metamask
- Ganache

## Results

Results after each execution as per the steps identified in assignment are in the folder "Execution Results" in this github repository.

Below were the steps executed 

- Use the setAccounts function to define the authorized Ethereum address that will be able to withdraw funds from your contract.
- Test the deposit functionality of your smart contract by sending the following amounts of ether. After each transaction, use the contractBalance function to verify that the funds were added to your contract:

Transaction 1: Send 1 ether as wei.

Transaction 2: Send 10 ether as wei.

Transaction 3: Send 5 ether.

- Once you’ve successfully deposited funds into your contract, test the contract’s withdrawal functionality by withdrawing 5 ether into accountOne and 10 ether into accountTwo. After each transaction, use the contractBalance function to verify that the funds were withdrawn from your contract. Also, use the lastToWithdraw and lastWithdrawAmount functions to verify that the address and amount were correct.
